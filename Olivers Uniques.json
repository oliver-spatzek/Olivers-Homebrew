				"This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the bottle you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the bottle until the spell ends or until you destroy the bottle, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the bottle, you can use it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to 3 times. Once you use a soul for the third time, it becomes inert, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.",
				"Borrow Life: You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain {@dice 2d8} hit points.",
